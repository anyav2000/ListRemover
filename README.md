# ListRemover
Given a file containing a list of names with one name on each line, this program will search through the list for partial matches
and output the names that match to the console. Then the user can pick one of these to remove from the list.

This project is losely based on one found in the book: "Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills" by Brian 
P. Hogan.
